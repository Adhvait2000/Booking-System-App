# M0vie Booking and LIsting Management Application (MOBLIMA)

The main objective of this assignment is to:
• apply the Object-Oriented (OO) Design concepts you have learnt in the course,
• model, design and develop a quality OO application fulfilling the project

#Assumptions:

1. This application is for use by a single user and concurrent access is not considered 
2. For demonstration purposes, three cineplexes have been created 
3. The currency utilised is Singapore Dollar (SGD) and it is inclusive of Good and Services Tax (GST). 
4. A simplified login system has been created for use by cinema staff only 
5. Once the booking has been confirmed, the payment is always successful. 
6. No interfaces made with external systems, e.g. Payment, printer, etc.
7. Discounted tickets for students and senior citizens can be purchased online without validation of their age. These will be verified at the entrance of the cinema.
